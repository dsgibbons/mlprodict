    I was expecting the following code to be produce unique keys.
    But it seems python objects for the nodes are created one the fly
    and destroyed in the same loop. Then `id(node)` are not unique.

    ::

        for node in onnx_model.graph.node:
            key = id(node)

    It is also not sure that the same loop would
    produce the same results if run a second time
    later in the code.
